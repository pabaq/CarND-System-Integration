'''
/vehicle/traffic_lights provides you with the location of the traffic light in 
3D map space and helps you acquire an accurate ground truth data source for the 
traffic light classifier by sending the current color state of all traffic 
lights in the simulator. When testing on the vehicle, the color state will not 
be available. You'll need to rely on the position of the light and the camera 
image to predict it.
